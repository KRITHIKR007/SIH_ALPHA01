# 🚀 MINDPIECE Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy the MINDPIECE dyslexia screening platform to Streamlit Cloud for public access.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Required Files (✅ Already Created)
- [x] `streamlit_app.py` - Main application entry point
- [x] `requirements-streamlit.txt` - Streamlit-specific dependencies  
- [x] `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- [x] `packages.txt` - System dependencies
- [x] `secrets.toml.template` - Template for secrets configuration

### Repository Requirements
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub repository
- [x] Repository is public or you have Streamlit Cloud access to private repos
- [x] All sensitive data removed from code (using environment variables)

## 🌟 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. Ensure all code is committed and pushed to GitHub
2. Verify `streamlit_app.py` is in the root directory
3. Check that `requirements-streamlit.txt` contains all necessary dependencies

### Step 2: Access Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Grant necessary permissions to access your repositories

### Step 3: Deploy Your App
1. Click "New app" or "Create app"
2. Select your repository: `KRITHIKR007/SIH_ALPHA01`
3. Set the main file path: `streamlit_app.py`
4. Choose branch: `master` (or your main branch)
5. Click "Deploy!"

### Step 4: Configure Secrets (Optional)
If you want to connect to a backend API later:

1. Go to your app settings in Streamlit Cloud
2. Click on "Secrets"
3. Add the following configuration:

```toml
[general]
API_BASE_URL = "https://your-backend-api.herokuapp.com"
DEMO_MODE = "false"

[api_keys]
# Add any API keys here if needed
# OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
```

## 🎯 Full-Featured App Features

The app now includes **all MINDPIECE capabilities** with intelligent fallback:

✅ **Complete UI**: Full dyslexia screening interface with all analysis modules
✅ **OpenDyslexic Font**: Accessibility-first design throughout
✅ **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Text, handwriting, and speech analysis interfaces
✅ **Admin Panel**: Complete administrative tools and session management
✅ **TTS Interface**: Text-to-speech generation with speed controls
✅ **Real API Integration**: Connects to backend when available
✅ **Demo Mode Fallback**: Works standalone when backend is unavailable
✅ **Professional Branding**: Full MINDPIECE visual identity

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: App fails to start
- **Solution**: Check `requirements-streamlit.txt` for missing dependencies
- **Check**: Ensure `streamlit_app.py` has no syntax errors

**Issue**: Modules not found
- **Solution**: Verify all imports are available in `requirements-streamlit.txt`
- **Check**: Remove any backend-specific imports

**Issue**: Large file uploads fail
- **Solution**: Files are processed in demo mode, no actual backend processing
- **Check**: Streamlit Cloud has a 200MB file limit

**Issue**: Font not loading
- **Solution**: Font is loaded via CDN, may take a moment to load
- **Check**: Fallback fonts (Comic Sans MS) are available

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### File Size Optimization:
- Demo mode doesn't actually process large files
- Files are validated but not sent to backend
- Focus on UI/UX demonstration

### Loading Speed:
- Custom CSS is optimized for fast loading
- Font loading uses `font-display: swap`
- Images and assets are compressed

## 🌐 Public Access

Once deployed, your app will be available at:
```
https://share.streamlit.io/[username]/[repo-name]/[branch]/streamlit_app.py
```

Example:
```
https://share.streamlit.io/krithikr007/sih_alpha01/master/streamlit_app.py
```

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance
